yesterday I was finishing the story to update an approved cash flow

today I started with the story to add AMS Solution id in Cashflows

-> the idea is that the new curves will have 0 as client_curve_id in the curves database

-> if I want to add a new curves in cashflows with client_curve_id = 0 the user must enter AMS_Solution_ID

-> if I want to add a new curves in cashflows with client_curve_id > 0 it autocompletes AMS_Solution_ID
