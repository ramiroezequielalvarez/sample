Responsibility for Validation:

Frontend (Angular): Initial validation should be done on the client to enhance user experience and prevent unnecessary uploads.

Eg. const allowedTypes = ['application/xls']; + 

Backend (C#): The primary responsibility lies with the server to enforce strict file upload restrictions because client-side validations can be bypassed by attackers.

Eg. var allowedTypes = new[] { "application/xls" } + long maxSizeInBytes = 2 * 1024 * 1024;
