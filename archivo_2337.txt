In a while I will share the PRs the cashflows. I have the migration script set up to transfer all the "Codes" from client curves to Cashflows, where it matches through its ClientCurveId.

So, could I remove the unique constraint from ClientCurveId in the Curves database and assign it a default value of 0 for all new client curves I create in Curves?
