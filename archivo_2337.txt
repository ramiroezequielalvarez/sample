const date = new Date('2020-10-10');
this.addConsultantCurveForm.patchValue({
  asOfDatePicker: date,
  effectiveDatePicker: date
});


The migration didn’t affect any Sigma code. What was done, however, was an upgrade of ag-grid, which shouldn’t have any impact either. Nothing specific was changed, so I think the best option might be to test things a bit and see if the flows are still working fine



const fecha = '2020-10-10';
const fechaCompleta = fecha + noTimeZone;

const date = moment('2025-05-01', 'YYYY-MM-DD');

this.addConsultantCurveForm.patchValue({
  asOfDatePicker: date,
  effectiveDatePicker: date,
});

this.addConsultantCurveForm.get('asOfDatePicker')?.setValue(momentDate, { emitEvent: true });




const control = this.addConsultantCurveForm.get('asOfDatePicker');

control?.setValue(null); // limpiar primero
control?.setValue(momentDate); // luego setear valor real





Yes, your implementation works fine. The issue is that in the database the CreatedBy field in consultantCurveData would be null.

Although your approach works, maybe when deploying a script could be created to assign the correct value to the consultantcurvedata field.
