If you hit an ERR_OSSL_EVP_UNSUPPORTED error in your application with Node.js 17, it’s likely that your application or a module you’re using is attempting to use an algorithm or key size which is no longer allowed by default with OpenSSL 3.0. A command-line option, --openssl-legacy-provider, has been added to revert to the legacy provider as a temporary workaround for these tightened restrictions.

###
--openssl-legacy-provider
Added in: v16.17.0
Enable OpenSSL 3.0 legacy provider when dynamically linking to OpenSSL 3.x. For more information please see OSSL_PROVIDER-legacy.
