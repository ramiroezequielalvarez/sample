Regarding your questions:

Yes, the most recent status should be displayed, following the current PastDue logic.

David mentioned that the variance should always be shown, for all users.

There should be a delete functionality—not for the parent entry (since that data comes from the Poller), but for the details. For example, in the case of a manual Mercer curve, a user might accidentally add a row with AsOfDate and EffectiveDate set to 2040-10-10 and would need to perform a logical (not physical) deletion.

Now, regarding the tasks...

Keep in mind that only manual curves (consultant) will have the option to be edited and deleted.

CCSOL-2211: This task defines the retrieval of automatic (daily) curves.

CCSOL-2252: This task defines the retrieval of manual (consultant) curves and currently includes editing functionality.

CCSOL-2253: This task defines the retrieval of manual curve details.

The user stories look good to me. What I would suggest adding is a separate task to cover:

→ Add + Edit + Delete manual (consultant) curves — leaving CCSOL-2252 focused only on retrieval, without editing.

CCSOL-2212: This is a user story.

The PastDue logic is as follows: if one month has passed since a row was marked as "Pending", and the latest status of that row is not Pending or Pending Approval, then it should be shown as PastDue.

Examples:

PastDue: true & Status: Approved → Display as PastDue

PastDue: true & Status: Pending → Display as Pending
