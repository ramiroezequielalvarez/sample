Hi Stan, I hope you are well.

I just wanted to let you know that I was planning to take a vacation during the month of August, specifically from Monday, August 14 through Friday, August 23, returning to work on Monday, August 26. 

I consider that this date is good since the idea is to have all the cashflows module ready by mid-July, since it is quite advanced. And then I would have 1 more month for any problems that might happen. 

If it's ok with you, I can let the team know. On the DataArt side, I already got the Ok.

Regards, 

Ramiro
