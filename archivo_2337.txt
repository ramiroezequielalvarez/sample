I know the price of a stock today. I know the strike price of an option today. Therefore, if I build my portfolio using a binomial option model, I can determine the theoretical value of an option today. And in this way, I can know if it is expensive or cheap.

If the binomial model is 1-period, the valuation will be less precise because it cannot capture the price dynamics. In contrast, with N periods, my valuation (whether it is expensive or cheap) will be more accurate.

A binomial model with a large number of periods can provide a valuation close to that given by the Black-Scholes model and providing a more accurate estimate of whether an option is expensive or cheap
