The idea is to have 3 independent branches ready to deploy to TEST.

Camille's work is consumed by Erica. Erica's work is then consumed by Ramiro.

Camille always works in the /feature/client-curves branch.
- If she wants to deploy to TEST her branch (which only has wireframes) she can just deploy her /feature/client-curves branch in [UI].

Erica always works on the /feature/client-curves-wired branch. 
	- she can merge her branch with Camille's branch on a daily basis. This way she has the html, css and mocks up to date. 
- When she considers necessary, she can deploy her branch to Test. 
	- This requires deploying the following branches to test
			[domain] - branch: feature/cons-curve-approval 
			[data] - branch: feature/cons-curve-approval  
			[query] - branch: feature/cons-curve-approval  
			[command] -branch: feature/cons-cons-curve-approval  
			[UI] - branch: /feature/client-curves-wired

Ramiro always works on the /feature/client-curve-approved branch.
	- I merge my branch with Erica's branch on a daily basis. This way I have Camille + Erica's changes.
- when I consider necessary I can deploy her branch to Test.
	- This requires deploying the following branches to test
			[domain] - branch: feature/client-curve-approval 
			[data] - branch: feature/client-curve-approval  
			[query] - branch: feature/client-curve-approval  
			[command] -branch: feature/client-curve-approval  
			UI] - branch: /feature/client-curve-approval [UI] - branch: /feature/client-curve-approval
